# slidedown

Generate slides with Markdown

## Usage

Write your talk. Currently, the syntax highlight lexer defaults to Ruby.
Adding support for specifying languages is in the TODOs.

    !SLIDE
    
    # This is my talk
    
    !SLIDE
    
    ## I hope you enjoy it
    
    !SLIDE code
    
        def foo
          :bar
        end
    
    !SLIDE
    
    Google is [here](http://google.com)
    
    !SLIDE
    
    # Questions?

Generate the output:

    $ slidedown my-talk.md

### Custom Styles

To add custom styles to your slides, just create stylesheets in the same directory as your presentation's markdown file:

    | - presentation-directory
      | - slides.md
      | - styles.css

The additional styles will be added to your generated slides.

## Syntax Highlighting

slidedown syntax highlighting works just like Lighthouse's:

    @@@ ruby
    def foo
      :bar
    end
    @@@

Or for JavaScript

    @@@ js
      function foo() {
        return 'bar';
      }
    @@@

### Requirements

* RDiscount
* Nokogiri
* pygments (for syntax highlighting)
* [makers-mark][http://github.com/nakajima/makers-mark]

## Todo

* Other means of navigation besides left/right keys
* Vertical view of all slides in a row
* Generate PDFs (maybe via cucumber)
* Stop making Nokogiri sad when parsing out snippets
